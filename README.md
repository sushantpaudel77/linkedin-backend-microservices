🛠️ TODO: Externalized Configuration with Spring Cloud Config
🎯 Goal: Centralize all microservice configs (ports, DB creds, Kafka, etc.) into a shared Git repo, removing local application.yml dependency.

✅ Steps to Integrate:
 Set up a Spring Cloud Config Server

 Use the shared Git repo for configs → e.g., spring-cloud-config-repo

 Move each service's configs into the repo (application-{service}.yml)

 Point all microservices to the Config Server:

🔗 My Public Config Server URL:
https://github.com/sushantpaudel77/github-linkedin-config-server

 Add spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://your-config-server-domain.com in each service

 (Optional) Enable live config updates via Spring Boot Actuator + Cloud Bus

📘 Docs: Spring Cloud Config

This makes config management centralized, version-controlled, and scalable across environments.

# 🐳 LinkedIn Backend Microservices — Full Docker Compose Stack

This is a complete `docker-compose.yml` setup** for my LinkedIn backend clone.

It includes:

- Kafka & Kafbat UI
- PostgreSQL Databases
- Neo4j (Graph DB for Connections)
- Spring Boot Microservices
- Eureka Discovery Server
- API Gateway

> ✅ **Note**: I’ve modularized this setup into **three smaller Compose files** for better management in most workflows.

This file serves as an **all-in-one alternative** — ideal for **quick local testing** or when a unified stack is easier to manage.

---

## 🔀 See the Modular Files

For advanced or staged deployments, use the split Compose files:

- [`docker-compose.base.yml`](./docker-compose.base.yml)
- [`docker-compose.kafka-zipkin.yml`](./docker-compose.kafka-zipkin.yml)
- [`docker-compose.posts-user.yml`](./docker-compose.posts-user.yml)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔧 Split Compose Files (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml \
               -f docker-compose.kafka-zipkin.yml \
               -f docker-compose.posts-user.yml up

🧱 All-in-One Compose
docker-compose up --build

☸️ Kubernetes Deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/

⚙️ Resource Configuration
Kubernetes resource limits and requests can be adjusted based on your environment's needs to optimize performance and resource usage.
For example, in ./k8s/connections-db.yml:

resources:
  limits:
    memory: "1024Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "200m"
requests define the minimum guaranteed resources.

📦 Microservices Overview
Service	Port	Description
🧭 API Gateway	8080	Entry point for all requests
🧬 Discovery Server	8761	Eureka registry for service discovery
👤 User Service	9011	Handles user authentication & profiles
